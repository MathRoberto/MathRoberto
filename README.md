Hello!My name is Matheus Roberto, but you can call me Roberto if you feel comfortable; that's the way everyone calls me! I am a software engineering student at 
UniAcademia in Juiz de Fora, MG-Brazil. Currently, I'm pretending to be a front-end developer in the near future and learning as many frameworks as I can!

When I'm not coding or working, I'd like to read some books (mainly fantasy ones; that's my favourite genre), watch some series or anime, and even play some games
with my friends or hang out with them at a bar, a restaurant, a cinema, or even a party! You can say I'm an outgoing person. If I'm not doing this, 
I can be exploring and expanding my hobbies, such as cooking (that's my main one), walking, driving around, and traveling when I can, or discovering new ones, 
as I always like to have something to do when I'm in the mood for doing so.
