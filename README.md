Hello!My name is Matheus Roberto, feel free to call me Roberto, that's the way I am known by the others. I am a software engineering student at UniAcademia in Juiz de Fora, MG-Brazil. Currently, I intend to be a front-end developer in a very near future and learning as many frameworks as I can!

Not coding nor working, I like reading some manga or books (mainly fantasy ones; that's my favourite genre), watch some series or anime, and even play some games with my friends or hang out with them at a bar, a restaurant, a cinema, or parties! I would say that I'm an outgoing person. If I'm not on that, I will be exploring and expanding my hobbies, such as cooking which I enjoy the most , walking, driving around, and traveling whenever it´s possible, or figuring out new activies, as usual, I´ve been always having something to do when I am into that..
